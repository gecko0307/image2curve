# Autotrace
GIMP+Blender plugin bundle to export transparent images from GIMP layers to Blender curves as vectorized outlines. This is useful to create complex 2D shapes in Blender that are tedious to create manually. For example, you can create a mesh for a drawn character and animate it with armature or shape keys.
